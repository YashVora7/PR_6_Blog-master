# Blog API Project Instructions

## **Total Marks: 10**

### Running the Server

1. Start the server on **PORT 8090**. Ensure strict adherence to this port number.

---

## Project Overview

You are tasked with building an API for a Blog. The project should include the following features:

- CRUD operations performed by the admin.
- Adding comments and likes by the user only.
- take reference visit https://proud-red-butterfly.cyclic.app/blog/

---

## Follow these instructions strictly

---

## Implement in MVC Structure

### Database Connection

1. Create a 'config' folder. Inside this folder, create a file named 'db.js'. Write logic to connect to MongoDB using an online database such as MongoDB Atlas.

---

### Database Schema Design

#### User Schema Design

2. Create a 'Models' folder.
   - Inside this folder, create a file named 'user.schema.js' with the following schema:

```js
{
  username,
  password,
  email,
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["user", "admin"], // Define allowed roles
    default: "user", // Default role is 'user'
  }
}
```

#### Blog Schema Design

3. Create a new file inside the 'Models' folder named 'Blog.schema.js':

```js
{
  title: String,
  content: String,
  image: String,
  author: String,
  category:String,
  likedBy: [{ username: String }],
  comments: [{
      text: String,
      username: String,
      date: { type: Date, default: Date.now } }]
}
```

<!-- signup -->

## Sign Up and Login

### Sign Up - POST route

- **Endpoint**: Create a POST route at `/user/signup`.
- send in response only username how signed up =
- suppose {username:testingUser , email:testing@gmail.com} trying to sign up if it already exists check by email then send in response `testingUser` if not exits then create user then send `Account created successfully username`where `username` is replaced with the actual username of the user who created in.
- After a successful login, set cookies in the browser with the user's `role` and `id`.
- **Front-end Page**: Create a sign-up page using EJS, and make a GET route at `/user/signup` to render this page.

#### Form Setup

1. Create an HTML form with the ID `form` for user sign-up.

2. Within the form, provide the following input fields with corresponding IDs:
   - `username` (ID: `username`)
   - `password` (ID: `password`)
   - `email` (ID: `email`)
   - `role` (ID: `role`) : - it should be dropdown

<!-- login -->

### Login - POST route

- Create a POST route named `/user/login`.
- Create a login page using EJS.
- Create a GET route at `/user/login`.
- Take email and password as input for the login.
- Create an HTML form with the ID `form` for user log in.
- Within the form, provide the following input fields with corresponding IDs:

  - `password` (ID: `password`)
  - `email` (ID: `email`)

- After successful login, send a message that says `Welcome User username`, where `username` is replaced with the actual username of the user who logged in.
- After a successful login, set cookies in the browser with the user's `role` and `id`.

<!-- error handle -->

#### Handle Incorrect Email or Password

- If the email or password provided during login is incorrect, display a message on the login page indicating `Invalid Credentials.`

<!-- ### Delete user

- Make sure that you can delete users from your application by adding an endpoint called `DELETE /users/:id` -
- send response `user deleted username`where `username` is replaced with the actual username of the user who deleted.

## Blog

## Create a Blog Post Form

1. **POST Route for Blog Creation:** Begin by creating a POST route with the path `/blog/create`. This route will handle the creation of new blog posts.

2. **Create a Blog Post Form Using EJS:** Develop a blog post creation form using EJS. Configure a GET route at `/blog/create` to render this form.

3. **Collect User Input:** The form should collect input for the following fields:

- form (ID `blogForm`)
- Title (ID: `title`)
- Content (ID: `content`)
- category (ID:`category`)
- Image (ID: `image`)

4. **Set Author's Name:** Retrieve the author's name from cookies.

- make middleware to check title and content image, category are coming or not if not then send (`All fields are required`)

# - do not use required in form

5. **Authorization Check:** Before rendering the form, perform an authorization check. If a regular user is logged in and not an admin, show a message such as `You are not authorized to access this page.` and prevent them from accessing the form. you can use cookies to verify

- admin can not add comments and like to any blogs

6. **Admins:** (admins) can add new blog posts. Include authorization

- after send adding blog send response (`blog created by [adminname]`) where `[adminname]` is replaced with the actual adminname
- set that blog id in cookies give name `blogId`

# GET route - Fetch and Render All Blogs

<!-- mange filters as well -->

1. Create a GET route at `/blog/blogs`.

- if you get category in query then send all related
  else

2. send a response containing all available blogs.

## Render the Blog Page

1. Create a GET route at `/blog/`.
2. Set up this route to render your blog page.
3. Display all blogs on the page.
4. make a proper navbar and add path and include in all page

## Blog Page Structure

1. Create a div with the ID `parent-box`.

   - Inside this div, append all blogs in separate divs with the class `list`.

2. For each blog entry, include the following elements within the `list` div:
   - An image tag with the class `img` to display the blog's image.
   - A paragraph (p) tag with the class `title` to display the blog's title.

<!-- optional -->

3. add filter tag if we clicked any then it should be world

- there should be these category present
- technology
- sports
- healthx

- you can add more

### DELETE route

- Create a DELETE route named `/blog/delete/:id`.
- Only admins can delete.

### PATCH route

- Create a PATCH route named `/blog/edit/:id`.
- Send all data after editing blogs.
- Only admins can edit.

<!-- single blog page  -->

### GET Route with ID

1. Create a GET route at `/blog/singleBlog/:id`.
2. Send a single blog by its ID.
3. Use EJS to send and render that blog. Hint:
   ```js
   res.render("singleBlogPage", { singleBlog });
   ```

When a user clicks on a single blog from the page that displays all blogs, the single blog page should be shown. This page should have the following HTML structure:

- `div` with `id=blog`.
- `img` tag with `id=img` to display the blog's image.
- `h3` tag for the title with `id=title`.
- `span` tag for the category with `id=category`.
- `p` tag for the content with `id=content`.
- `button` for like `id=like`
- `span` for displaying number of like `id=count`
- `form` make form for adding comment `id=comment`

### Make PATCH route

- Route name `/blog/like/:id`
- login or signup required for like
- pass blog id
- ## hint ; - there are many way to blog id
  - you can use :
  ```js
  let url = window.location.href.split("/");
  let id = url[url.length - 1];
  ```
- Add a like to the database with the username
- use cookies to set username
- add event on like button when user hit the like button that time it should work
- send that whole blog in object

### Make PATCH route

- Route name `/blog/comment/:id`
- pass blog id

  ```
- login or signup required for comment
- Add comments to the database with username and text
- use cookies to set username
- Send that blog
- you can added by ui or only make logic

<!-- flexible searching features -->

1. Set up a new GET route `/blog/search` in your Express.js application.

2. Extract the search query from the request query parameters (`req.query.blogs`).
3. Implement flexible search logic to handle different types of queries (e.g., title, author, category).
4. Search in your blog data for matches in categories, authors, and titles, based on the search query.

5. To handle wrong spellings or approximate matches, consider using a library like "fuzzy" or "string-similarity" to compare the search query to existing data. This allows you to find close matches, even with misspelled words.

6. Return the search results, including any approximate matches, as JSON in the response.

<!-- hint use fuse.js || fuzzy.js  -->

```js
npm  i fuse.js

const Fuse = require("fuse.js");
blog.get(`/blog/search`,(req,res)=>{

let query = req.query.blogs;
  const blogs = await blog.find();

  const options = {
    keys: ["author", "category", "title"],
  };
  const fuse = new Fuse(blogs, options);
  const result = fuse.search(query);

})

```

<!-- read if you are not getting -->

1. `let query = req.query.blogs;`: This line gets the search query from the user. The user enters their search term as a URL parameter, like `http://locahost:8090/blog/search?blogs=your_query`.

2. `const blogs = await blog.find();`: It fetches a list of blogs from a database. Think of it as a collection of articles or posts.

3. `const options = { keys: ["author", "category", "title"] };`: This line tells the program where to look for the search term. It searches for the query in the "author," "category," and "title" of the blogs.

4. `const fuse = new Fuse(blogs, options);`: This sets up a search tool that uses the `options` to find results in the `blogs`.

5. `const result = fuse.search(query);`: This performs the search. It looks for blogs that match the `query` (the user's search term) in the "author," "category," and "title" fields of the blogs. The `result` contains the matching blogs.

# <!-- bonos write logic for the Pagination -->

```js
## Testing Your Score

1. Navigate to the 'test' directory using `cd test`.
2. Run 'npm i' to install dependencies. If you encounter any errors during installation, you can use the following command: `./node_modules/.bin/cypress install`.
3. Run tests using either `npx cypress open` or `npx cypress run`.

**Best of Luck!**
